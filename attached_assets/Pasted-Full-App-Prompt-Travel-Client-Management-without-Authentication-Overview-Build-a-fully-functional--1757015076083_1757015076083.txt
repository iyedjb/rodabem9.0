View detailed client profiles including children

Edit client and children data

Delete clients with confirmation

Encrypt sensitive fields (CPF, RG, Passport Number) before saving to Firestore

No user authentication required — open access app

Sort clients by last name, travel date, or created date

Show key summary info: full name, phone, destination, travel date

3. Client Detail View

Read-only view of all client details including children

Button to switch to edit mode

Editable form with validation, same as add form

Save updates back to Firestore, encrypting sensitive fields again

Show timestamps of creation and last update

4. Delete Client

Technical Requirements
Frontend

Framework: React (or your preferred modern JS framework)

Use Firebase Web SDK for Firestore interaction

Use React Router (or equivalent) for navigation between list, add, and detail pages

Use date pickers for date inputs

Use dropdown selects for gender and civil status

Client-side validation including CPF validation (e.g. cpf-cnpj-validator
)

Encryption of sensitive data fields on the client before Firestore writes (e.g., using crypto-js
)

Responsive design for desktop and mobile

Backend

Firestore data model:

clients collection stores client documents

Each client document has a children subcollection

Firestore security rules:

Open read/write access OR limit access based on IP or other measures if needed

Validate data types and required fields

Use server timestamps for created_at and updated_at

Security

Encrypt CPF, RG, and passport number fields before saving to Firestore

Use HTTPS via Firebase Hosting (default)
